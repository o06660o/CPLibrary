My personal code snippets for competitive programming.

## Repository Layout

- `src/`: `.hpp` files are code snippets, and `.md` files are additional
  information used in competitive programming.
- `test/`: test cases to test correctness of the code snippets in `src/`
  with the help of [competitive-verifier].
- `export/`: export files in `src/` into a single PDF file for offline use.
- `archive/`: old PDF files exported are stored here.
